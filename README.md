MapUI App
MapUI is a React application that allows users to interact with a map interface using OpenStreetMap (OSM). The app provides various features to explore and interact with the map, including adding markers, selecting regions, and displaying region-specific information.

Features
Map Interface: The app displays an interactive map powered by OpenStreetMap, allowing users to explore different locations and zoom in/out to view the map at different scales.

Add Markers: Users can add markers to the map by clicking on any desired location. Each marker will be assigned a unique ID and display a popup with marker information.

Region Selection: The app provides a form input with three region options: United States, India, and United Kingdom. Users can select any of these regions from the dropdown.

Load Region: After selecting a region, users can click the "Load" button to load the selected region on the map. The map will update its center and zoom level to display the selected country.

Region Info: Upon loading a region, a card will show additional information about the selected region, including currency symbol, units of speed, distance, and volume (e.g., kmph, kilometers, liters), and timezone(s) information.

Night Mode: The app features a night mode toggle switch in the sidebar, allowing users to switch between day and night modes for the map display.
